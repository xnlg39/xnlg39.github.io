                    When looking at global warming it can be easy to think that
                    our actions are futile in the uphill battle against climate
                    change. The reality is that we as individuals have all the
                    power. The global warming we see today is a result of
                    decisions made by individuals. In 2020 the average carbon
                    footprint of a person in the UK was about 12 tonnes of CO2e.
                    In this article, I will explain how an individual can
                    potentially drop their carbon footprint to 5.2 tonnes with
                    little extra hassle. I will explore the four main areas that
                    impact the environment and how to either remove them
                    completely or reduce them significantly.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The average CO2 emission per person in the UK due to
                    electricity is roughly 2.5 tonnes. This works out to be
                    about 20% of an average individuals carbon footprint. This
                    is a significant chunk. However, it is easy to quantify,
                    reduce and save yourself money in the process!

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The first and most significant change you can make is to
                    switch to a green energy provider. In the Uk, we already
                    have multiple options, many of which are cheaper than their
                    biggest competitors. Take

                    as an example. They charge a monthly membership fee of
                    around £10/month and then sell you electricity at the price
                    they buy it from the grid. For individuals who consume a lot
                    of energy, it works out significantly cheaper as a result.

                    Now that all your electricity is green, your carbon
                    footprint due to electricity is now zero, reducing your
                    usage simply reduces your bill. however, for the sake of
                    completeness, it is worth mentioning some ways to reduce
                    electricity consumption. The obvious one we have all heard
                    about is LED's, in fact switching your house over to LED's
                    will pay itself off in less than a year on the lower end of
                    usage (4hrs/day) and they will last far longer. Modern
                    electrical appliances are more efficient than older ones as
                    a rule however this must be taken with a pinch of salt.
                    Although replacing your household with brand new electrical
                    appliances would be fun, the effect this shopping spree will
                    have on the environment will be significant and likely
                    outweigh any increase in efficiency. Finally, switching to
                    smart device management allows for more control of
                    appliances. Things like lights, heating, television and more
                    can be switched on and off at set times and from your phone.
                    This can make sure appliances are not left on and wasting
                    precious energy.

                <h3>Heating</h3>
                <br />
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Heating also makes up a large proportion of an individual's
                    carbon footprint. The average carbon footprint of an
                    individual in the UK due to heating is roughly 1.8 tonnes.
                    This works out to be about 15% of an average individuals
                    carbon footprint. Reducing the emissions here can be split
                    into two main sections. Heat production and heat
                    retention/management of the home. Both are important when it
                    comes to reducing the greenhouse gas production however it
                    is rather expensive to change your method of heat production
                    and although it would likely pay itself off in the long run,
                    it can be a large investment up front.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>Heat production</h5>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Currently, there are lots of exciting ways to heat your
                    house and water. Although it varies from house to house a
                    Heat pump is probably the best way to heat your home. In
                    conjunction with a green energy plan, your heatings carbon
                    footprint would become zero due to the fact that a heat pump
                    runs off of electricity. They are expensive to install and
                    the version that is right for you is largely dependent on
                    the house it is being installed in. This is a far better
                    option than electrical radiators and an electric boiler.
                    Although this would also be 100% green it would also cost
                    far more to run. This form of electric heating is very
                    inefficient and your monthly bill will reflect this.

                    Modern-day insulation has come on leaps and bounds over the
                    last decade, providing lots of fantastic options for your
                    home. Once again price must be considered, one can upgrade
                    their house entirely with perfect insulation and this will
                    make a massive improvement to their heat retention, however,
                    this would also come at a large price. It is likely worth
                    hiring an energy performance assessor to look at your house,
                    it will cost around £50 and from there, you will be able to
                    see the most efficient places to spend your money. A list of

                    search of cheap insulation for any part of your home will
                    provide all you need. Options such as insulated wallpaper
                    won't break the bank but they can make a noticeable

                    One of the best purchases you can make for your home's
                    heating is smart controls. They allow for easy management of
                    your heating and electrical system. Most can be controlled
                    from your phone or laptop and can make adjustments to your
                    heating schedule based on information such as weather and if

                    question. With little quantification, however, we can still
                    make some general statements of what is better for the
                    environment and what isn't.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Probably the single most debated topic when looking at foods
                    effect on the climate. All animals create carbon dioxide as
                    they respire and some Animals such as Ruminants produce
                    methane during their digestion process which is a very
                    potent greenhouse gas (learn more in the drop-down bellow).
                    Furthermore, Animals must eat food in order to create edible
                    protein. Vegans and vegetarians make the argument that this
                    is inefficient and Humans could simply eat the plant matter
                    themself skipping the middle man and removing the methane
                    and carbon dioxide that the animals create as a by-product.
                    This, on paper, seems a valid argument however it is not the
                    full picture. Arguments can be made for humans evolving to
                    have meat in their diet and hence to be healthy we require
                    certain essential nutrients that can only be provided from
                    meat. Furthermore, there is a growing body of research
                    looking at regenerative farming. This involves farming in a
                    more natural way i.e. animals and crops forming beneficial
                    relationships. This research suggests that soil regeneration
                    and as a result, carbon storage can be achieved with a more
                    responsible approach to farming. This

                    suggests that regenerative farming can offset the entire
                    travel sectors carbon footprint.

                    looks at the carbon emission of lots of different foods. It
                    compared the carbon emission of meats and vegetables per
                    100g of protein. Beef and Sheep produce significantly more
                    greenhouse gas than other meats. Per 100g of beef protein,
                    the mean CO2 equivalent was 50kg. This works out to roughly
                    14kg of CO2e per portion of beef. The same portion of
                    chicken would only emit 1.6kg of CO2e. It must be noted that
                    this paper has looked at current farming practices and looks
                    at what is currently available in shops. These figures would
                    likely be different when considering local meat, farmed
                    using regenerative practices.

                    It is still clear that a general reduction in meat
                    consumption (especially Ruminants meat) is good for the
                    environment. In 2020 the average person in the UK consumed
                    roughly 62KG of meat. this works out to about 1.2KG of meat
                    per week which is 2 servings of meat a day. Meat is very
                    good for you when eaten in moderation but the keyword here
                    is moderation. Reducing meat consumption by half of the
                    national average would take you to 1 meat serving a day and
                    although hard to quantify exactly it will definitely reduce
                    the strain on the environment. Also by eating less meat,
                    individuals can afford to buy more ethically sourced meat.
                    Although this is outside of the scope of this site, it is
                    not hard to make an argument for why this is a good thing!

                                    Ruminants are herbivorous animals that are
                                    able to acquire nutrients from plant-based
                                    foods by fermenting them in a designated
                                    stomach prior to digestion. One of the main
                                    problems with Ruminants is a by-product of
                                    this fermentation process: Methane. Methane
                                    is thought to be about 80x more warming than
                                    CO2 however one should keep in mind that
                                    Methane in the upper-atmosphere undergoes
                                    free-radical reactions which break it down
                                    into CO2 and water over the space of a
                                    decade. Hence, although initially very
                                    potent after a decade its damage is
                                    drastically mitigated.

                                    upper-atmosphere it is subject to
                                    free-radicals. Free radicals are atoms,
                                    molecules, or ions that have unpaired
                                    valence electrons. This unpaired valence
                                    electron makes them far more reactive. These
                                    free-radicals are created by molecules and
                                    atoms being bombarded by sunlight in the

                                    filtered out by the atmosphere) can energise
                                    the molecules and atoms to form free
                                    radicals. The main atmospheric sink of
                                    methane is oxidation by hydroxyl radicals

                <h5>Local Produce</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Sourcing one's food more locally is not only good for the
                    environment, it is also good for your local community.
                    Buying local produce has a drastically reduced footprint due
                    to the minimised mileage on the goods. Although here in the
                    UK our crops are quite seasonal, there is still plenty of
                    produce year-round. Follow this

                    Hopefully, having got this far you are filled with
                    confidence that you have the power to save the environment.

                            remove your energy footprint but most likely save

                            a green energy plan. However more efficient
                            retention of heat would make a drastic impact for
                            those not looking to purchase a new boiler.

                            It must be noted that moving to an electric car with
                            a green enery plan would result in a reduction to

                    The above examples should be taken with a pinch of salt.
                    Some will be able to implement all of the above and
                    potentially go further. Others will not be able to afford a
                    new heat pump and stop using their car. This article should
                    be more of a guide on how one can, and should, take their
                    personal decisions seriously. The effect of everyone in the
                    UK simply halving their footprint would put the UK 20 years
                    ahead of schedule on the UK's climate roadmap outlined in
                    the Paris agreement. What stands between that, and where we
                    are now, is action!
