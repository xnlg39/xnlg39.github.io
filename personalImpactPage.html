                    The average CO2 emission per person in the UK due to
                    electricity is roughly 1.5 tonnes. This works out to be
                    about 10% of an average individuals carbon footprint. This
                    is a significant chunk. However, it is easy to quantify,
                    reduce and save yourself money in the process!

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The first and most significant change you can make is to
                    switch to a green energy provider. In the Uk, we already
                    have multiple options, many of which are cheaper than their
                    biggest competitors. Take

                    as an example. They charge a monthly membership fee of
                    around £10/month and then sell you electricity at the price
                    they buy it from the grid. For individuals who consume a lot
                    of energy, it works out significantly cheaper as a result.

                    Now that all your electricity is green, your carbon
                    footprint due to electricity is now zero, reducing your
                    usage simply reduces your bill. however, for the sake of
                    completeness, it is worth mentioning some ways to reduce
                    electricity consumption. The obvious one we have all heard
                    about is LED's, in fact switching your house over to LED's
                    will pay itself off in less than a year on the lower end of
                    usage (4hrs/day) and they will last far longer. Modern
                    electrical appliances are more efficient than older ones as
                    a rule however this must be taken with a pinch of salt.
                    Although replacing your household with brand new electrical
                    appliances would be fun, the effect this shopping spree will
                    have on the environment will be significant and likely
                    outweigh any increase in efficiency. Finally, switching to
                    smart device management allows for more control of
                    appliances. Things like lights, heating, television and more
                    can be switched on and off at set times and from your phone.
                    This can make sure appliances are not left on and wasting
                    precious energy.

                <h3>Heating</h3>
                <br />
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Heating also makes up a large proportion of an individual's
                    carbon footprint. The average carbon footprint of an
                    individual in the UK due to heating is roughly 1.5 tonnes.
                    Reducing the emissions here can be split into two main
                    sections. Heat production and heat retention/management of
                    the home. Both are important when it comes to reducing the
                    greenhouse gas production however it is rather expensive to
                    change your method of heat production and although it would
                    likely pay itself off in the long run, it can be a large
                    investment up front.
                </p>

                <h5>Heat production</h5>
                <br />
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Currently, there are lots of exciting ways to heat your
                    house and water. Although it varies from house to house a
                    Heat pump is probably the best way to heat your house. In
                    conjunction with a green energy plan, your heatings carbon
                    footprint would become zero due to the fact that a heat pump
                    runs off of electricity. They are expensive to install and
                    the version that is right for you is largely dependent on
                    the house it is being installed in.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    If you are on a green energy plan it would be tempting to
                    heat the house and water with electrical radiators and an
                    electric boiler. Although this would be 100% green it would
                    also cost far more than the other options. Electric heating
                    is very inefficient and your monthly bill will reflect this.

                    their house entirely with perfect insulation and will make a
                    massive improvement to their heat retention, however, this
                    would come at a large price. It is likely worth hiring an

                    cost around £50 and from there, you will be able to see the

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The topic of food and climate change is a heavily disputed
                    subject and it is mostly people pushing their own agenda
                    onto others. I will try to avoid this and keep it clear and
                    concise. Consumption of any kind has an effect on the
                    environment, whether you eat the greenest diet or not the
                    food you eat comes at a carbon cost. This carbon emission on
                    a given item of food is often hard to pinpoint due to the
                    complicated nature of the question. Without looking into
                    this, however, we can make some general statements of what
                    is better for the environment and what isn't.

                <h5>Meat</h5>
                <br />
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Probably the single most debated topic when looking at foods
                    effect on the climate. All animals create carbon dioxide as
                    they respire and other Animals such as Ruminants produce
                    methane during their digestion process which is a very
                    potent greenhouse gas. Furthermore, Animals must eat food in
                    order to create edible protein. Vegans and vegetarians make
                    the argument that this is inefficient and Humans could
                    simply eat the plant matter themself skipping the middle man
                    and removing the methane and carbon dioxide that the animals
                    create as a by-product. This on paper seems a valid argument
                    however it is not the full picture. Arguments can be made
                    for humans evolving to have meat in their diet and hence to
                    be healthy we require certain essential nutrients that can
                    only be provided from meat. Furthermore, there is a growing
                    mound of research looking at regenerative farming. This
                    involves farming in a more natural way i.e. Animals and
                    crops forming beneficial relationships. This research
                    suggests that soil regeneration and as a result, carbon
                    storage can be achieved with a more responsible approach to
                    farming.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Regardless of which side of the fence you stand, it is still
                    clear that a general reduction in meat consumption is good
                    for the environment. In 2020 the average person in the UK
                    consumed roughly 62KG of meat. this works out to about 1.2KG
                    of meat per week which is 2 servings of meat a day. Although
                    an exact value is hard to come up with it comes down to
                    comfort. Meat is very good for you when eaten in moderation
                    but the keyword here is moderation. Reducing meat
                    consumption by half of the national average would take you
                    to 1 meat serving a day and although hard to quantify it
                    will reduce the strain on the environment. Also by eating
                    less meat, individuals can afford to buy more ethically
                    sourced meat. Although this is outside of the scope of this
                    site, it is not hard to make an argument for why this is a
                    good thing.

                                    Ruminants are herbivorous animals that are
                                    able to acquire nutrients from plant-based
                                    foods by fermenting them in a designated
                                    stomach prior to digestion. One of the main
                                    problems with Ruminants is a by-product of
                                    this fermentation process: Methane. Methane
                                    is thought to be about 80x more warming than
                                    CO2 however one should keep in mind that
                                    Methane in the upper-atmosphere undergoes
                                    free-radical reactions which break it down
                                    into CO2 and water over the space of a
                                    decade[]. Hence, although initially very
                                    potent after a decade its damage is
                                    drastically mitigated.

                                    The atmospheric breakdown of methane makes
                                    up 90% of the total global Methane sink
                                    mechansim[]. As the Methane reaches the
                                    upper-atmosphere it is subject to
                                    free-radicals. Free radicals are atoms,
                                    molecules, or ions that have unpaired
                                    valence electrons. This unpaired valence
                                    electron makes them far more reactive. These
                                    free-radicals are created by molecules and
                                    atoms being bombarded by sunlight in the
                                    upper atmosphere. These higher energy
                                    photons from the sun (that have not been
                                    filtered out by the atmosphere) can energise
                                    the molecules and atoms to form free
                                    radicals. The main atmospheric sink of
                                    methane is oxidation by hydroxyl radicals
                                    (HO) which has multiple mechanisms but all
                                    end with less potent greenhouse gases. The
                                    net reaction seen in these equations is
                                    actually a sum of multiple complex
                                    reactions, however, these are a little
                                    complex for this site. Those who are
                                    interested in the whole process can find out

                                    It must be noted that Ruminants are not the
                                    only species that create methane. In fact,
                                    wetlands host the perfect environment for
                                    microbes that produce methane. Rice paddies

                                    themselves generate a large quantity of
