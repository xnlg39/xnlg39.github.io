                    When looking at global warming it can be easy to think that
                    our actions are futile in the uphill battle against climate
                    change. The reality is that we as individuals have all the
                    power. The global warming we see today is a result of
                    decisions made by individuals. In 2017 the average carbon
                    footprint of a person in the UK was about 12 tonnes of CO2
                    equivalent (CO2e)

                    The average annual CO2 emission per person in the UK due to
                    electricity is roughly 2.5 tonnes. This works out to be
                    about 20% of an average individuals carbon footprint. This
                    is a significant chunk. However, it is easy to quantify,

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The first and most significant change you can make is to
                    switch to a green energy provider. In the UK, we already
                    have multiple options, many of which are cheaper than their

                    Now that all your electricity is green, your carbon
                    footprint due to electricity is now zero, reducing your
                    usage simply reduces your bill, however, for the sake of
                    completeness, it is worth mentioning some ways to reduce
                    electricity consumption. The obvious one we have all heard
                    about is LED's, in fact switching your house over to LED's
                    will pay itself off in less than a year on the lower end of
                    usage (4hrs/day) and they will last far longer then less

                    older ones as a rule however this must be taken with a pinch
                    of salt. Although replacing your household with brand new
                    electrical appliances would be fun, the effect this shopping
                    spree will have on the environment will be significant and
                    likely outweigh any increase in efficiency. Finally,
                    switching to smart device management allows for more control
                    of appliances. Things like lights, heating, television and
                    more can be switched on and off at set times and from your
                    phone. This can make sure appliances are not left on and
                    wasting precious energy.

                    Heating also makes up a large proportion of an individual's
                    carbon footprint. The average carbon footprint of an

                    into two main sections. Heat production and heat
                    retention/management of the home. Both are important when it
                    comes to reducing the greenhouse gas production however it
                    is rather expensive to change your method of heat production
                    and although it would likely pay itself off in the long run,
                    it can be a large investment up front.

                <h5>Heat Production</h5>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Currently, there are lots of exciting ways to heat your
                    house and water. Although it varies from house to house a
                    Heat Pump is probably the best way to heat your home. In
                    conjunction with a green energy plan, your heatings carbon
                    footprint would become zero due to the fact that a Heat Pump
                    runs off of electricity. They are expensive to install and
                    the version that is right for you is largely dependent on
                    the house it is being installed in. This is a far better
                    option than electrical radiators and an electric boiler.
                    Although this would also be 100% green it would also cost
                    far more to run. This form of electric heating is very
                    inefficient and your monthly bill will reflect this.

                    Modern-day insulation has come on leaps and bounds over the
                    last decade, providing lots of fantastic options for your
                    home. Once again price must be considered, one can upgrade
                    their house entirely with perfect insulation and this will
                    make a massive improvement to their heat retention, however,
                    this would also come at a large price. It is likely worth
                    hiring an energy performance assessor to look at your house,
                    it will cost around £50, and from there you will be able to
                    see the most efficient places to spend your money. A list of

                    search of cheap insulation for any part of your home will
                    provide all you need. Options such as insulated wallpaper
                    won't break the bank but they can make a noticeable
                    difference. Improving your homes heat retention in this way
                    will not only be better for the environment, but over the

                    One of the best purchases you can make for your home's
                    heating is smart controls. They allow for easy management of
                    your heating and electrical system. Most can be controlled
                    from your phone or laptop and can make adjustments to your
                    heating schedule based on information such as weather and if
                    you are at home or not. Smart controls show an average

                    down on flights, especially long-distance ones would go
                    along way in reducing your impact on the environment. We
                    simply don't need to travel around the world to enjoy

                    must say we have everything we need right on our doorstep.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The topic of food and climate change is a heavily disputed
                    subject and from my own experience, most articles online are
                    people pushing their own agenda onto others. I will try to
                    avoid this and keep it clear and concise. Consumption of any
                    kind has an effect on the environment, whether you eat the
                    greenest diet or not the food you eat comes at a carbon
                    cost. This carbon emission on a given item of food is often
                    hard to quantify due to the complicated nature of the
                    question. With little quantification, however, we can still
                    make some general statements of what is better for the
                    environment and what isn't.

                <h5>Meat</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Probably the single most debated topic when looking at foods
                    effect on the climate. All animals create carbon dioxide as
                    they respire and some Animals such as Ruminants (for
                    example: Cows and Sheep) produce methane during their
                    digestion process which is a very potent greenhouse gas
                    (learn more in the drop-down bellow). Furthermore, Animals
                    must eat food in order to create edible protein. Vegans and
                    vegetarians make the argument that this is inefficient and
                    Humans could simply eat the plant matter themself skipping
                    the middle man and removing the methane and carbon dioxide
                    that the animals create as a by-product. This, on paper,
                    seems a valid argument however it is not the full picture.
                    Arguments can be made for humans evolving to have meat in
                    their diet and hence to be healthy we require certain
                    essential nutrients that can only be provided from meat.
                    Furthermore, there is a growing body of research looking at
                    regenerative farming. This involves farming in a more
                    natural way i.e. animals and crops forming beneficial
                    relationships. This research suggests that soil regeneration
                    and as a result, carbon storage can be achieved with a more
                    responsible approach to farming. Regenerative farming may be
                    able to offset the entire travel sectors carbon footprint

                    Regardless of which side of the fence you stand, ruminant
                    meat is impactful on the environment. When comparing the
                    carbon emission of meats and vegetables per 100g of protein

                    >. Beef and Sheep produce significantly more greenhouse gas
                    than other meats. Per 100g of beef protein, the mean CO2e
                    was 50kg. This works out to roughly 14kg of CO2e per portion
                    of beef. The same portion of chicken would only emit 1.6kg
                    of CO2e. It must be noted that this paper has looked at
                    current farming practices and looks at what is currently
                    available in shops. These figures would likely be different
                    when considering local meat, farmed using regenerative
                    practices.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    It is still clear that a general reduction in meat
                    consumption (especially Ruminants meat) is good for the
                    environment. In 2020 the average person in the UK consumed
                    roughly 62kg of meat. this works out to about 1.2kg of meat
                    per week which is 2 servings of meat a day. Meat is very
                    good for you when eaten in moderation, but the keyword here
                    is moderation. Reducing meat consumption by half of the
                    national average would take you to 1 meat serving a day and
                    although hard to quantify exactly it will definitely reduce
                    the strain on the environment. Also by eating less meat,
                    individuals can afford to buy more ethically sourced meat.
                    Although this is outside of the scope of this site, it is
                    not hard to make an argument for why this is a good thing!

                                    this fermentation process: methane. Methane

                                    It must be noted that Ruminants are not the
                                    only species that create methane. In fact,
                                    wetlands host the perfect environment for
                                    microbes that produce methane. Rice paddies
                                    often replicate these conditions and
                                    themselves generate a large quantity of

                                    the sources and sinks of methane.

                    Sourcing one's food more locally is not only good for the
                    environment, it is also good for your local community.
                    Buying local produce has a drastically reduced footprint due
                    to the minimised mileage on the goods. Although here in the
                    UK our crops are quite seasonal, there is still plenty of
                    produce year-round. Follow this

                    confidence that you have the power to save the environment.

                            retention of heat would make a drastic impact for

                    The above examples should be taken with a pinch of salt.
                    Some will be able to implement all of the above and
                    potentially go further. Others will not be able to afford a
                    new heat pump and stop using their car. This article should
                    be more of a guide on how one can, and should, take their
                    personal decisions seriously. The effect of everyone in the
                    UK simply halving their footprint would put the UK 20 years
                    ahead of schedule on the UK's climate roadmap outlined in
                    the Paris agreement. What stands between that, and where we
