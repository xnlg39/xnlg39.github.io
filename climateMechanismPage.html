                    Have you ever wondered what is known about the exact
                    mechanism that drives climate change? Sure, you know that
                    carbon dioxide is an important driver. But what is behind
                    all of the terms we hear in the media so often? In this
                    page, Laura will explain the science behind climate change
                    and why evidence shows we can attribute it to human
                    activity.

                    We are living in times where climate patterns change on
                    global and regional scales. These changes include a broad
                    range of observed effects, one of them being global warming.
                    The period of recent anthropogenic climate change has been
                    apparent since the mid to late 20th century. Both the
                    climate system and its changes have been studied in detail
                    by scientists around the world to understand the underlying
                    causes of the observed effects. Research includes
                    interdisciplinary work, ranging from environmental physics
                    and meteorology to atomic physics and biochemistry.

                    In this page, we will discover the physical science behind
                    climate change. Firstly, we will explore how solar radiation
                    and its interaction with the atmosphere affect climate
                    conditions. Knowing the ways in which climate conditions are
                    linked to heat absorption by atmospheric particles, we can
                    identify the main drivers of climate change. In the next
                    section, we will focus on the changes that have been
                    observed in the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (liquid water)
                    and cryosphere (ice). After that, we will carefully check if
                    these observations could be attributed to natural causes. We
                    will scrutinise why scientists seem to be so sure that
                    humans are responsible for Climate change. Knowing all of
                    this, we will take a brief look at the further effects that
                    can be expected assuming realistic conditions.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Life on Earth depends on external energy coming from the
                    Sun. Since the Sun and Earth are separated by vacuum, the
                    only mechanism of energy exchange is by radiation. The solar
                    irradiation at Earth’s orbit is S0= 1362 W/m2. The Earth
                    emits radiation as well, only at much longer wavelengths
                    (infrared). The more radiation the Earth absorbs and the
                    less is radiation re-emitted into space, the higher the
                    temperature on Earth. Therefore, it is vital to understand
                    the mechanism by which the Earth absorbs radiation from the
                    Sun and emits infrared radiation.

                    These processes are described in their most basic form by
                    Planck’s radiation law for black bodies. A black body is an
                    idealised object which absorbs radiation of all wavelengths
                    to 100%. A black body in thermal equilibrium, i.e. at a
                    constant temperature, emits electromagnetic black-body
                    radiation, which is described by Planck’s radiation
                    equation. It describes the spectral radiance B, i.e. how
                    much radiation is emitted per unit area and unit solid
                    angle, as a function of wavelength. The equation takes the
                    form:
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[E(\lambda, T)= \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda ^5}* \frac{1}{
                    \exp(\frac{hc}{\lambda kT})-1}\]
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light, \(T\) is the
                    temperature of the body, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\)
                    is the speed of light in a vacuum and \(k\) is the
                    Boltzmann's constant.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Using the above equation, we can plot the Planck emission
                    spectrum of both Sun and Earth as a function of wavelength.
                    Because the temperature of the Sun (TSun= 5504°C= 5777K) is
                    much larger than those of the Earth (TEarth=30°C=303K),
                    Earth emits radiation at lower energies and, hence, larger
                    wavelengths. Earth’s emission lies within the infrared
                    region. The difference in temperature also causes the total
                    radiation emission of the Earth to be lower compared to the
                    Sun’s.

                    We can use the black body approximation to calculate the
                    emission spectrum of the Sun. However, it is evident that
                    the Earth can hardly be called a black body. If the Earth
                    were a black body, all visible light would be absorbed and
                    from the outside the planet would appear to be entirely
                    black. However, this is not the case if you recall that
                    Earth looks fairly blue with a lot of white clouds from
                    space. In scientific terms, we say that the surface
                    reflectivity, also called albedo, in the visible regime is
                    greater than zero. About 30% of radiation from the Sun is
                    reflected, mainly by clouds, snow and ice.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Just like Earth doesn’t absorb all radiation perfectly, its
                    emission in the infrared regime is also lowered. The mean
                    emissivity, i.e. the effectiveness in emitting energy as
                    radiation in the infrared regime, is only about 95% of those
                    of an idealised black body.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Because of these imperfect absorption and emission
                    properties, scientists call Earth a grey body. This term is
                    misleading in the way that it has nothing to do with the
                    actual colour of the planet. Instead, it refers to the fact
                    that some visible light is reflected and less infrared
                    radiation is emitted.

                    In the simplest model the Earth is assumed to be a grey body

                    Assuming equilibrium of incoming and outgoing radiation

                    The origin of difference lies within what is called the
                    <strong>natural greenhouse effect</strong>. It is caused by
                    heat absorption of the atmosphere. In the previous model, we
                    disregarded the existence of the atmosphere. As it turns out
                    the atmosphere has a large effect on climate conditions.
                    Particularly, the well-known greenhouse gases contribute
                    largely to the warming of Earth, even though they only make
                    up about 0.1% of the atmosphere. To understand why this is,
                    we have to take a look at the absorption and transmission
                    properties of the atmosphere.

                    The figure shows that in the visible range most light is
                    transmitted, whereas most of the ultra-violet and infrared
                    radiation is absorbed. However, there is a so-called
                    atmospheric window, a gap in the total infrared absorption
                    where nearly unhindered infrared emission from the Earth’s
                    surface is possible. Since this atmospheric window matches
                    with the black body emission spectrum of the Earth (see the
                    first figure), radiation emitted by the surface should be
                    able to escape into space. If this were the case, the
                    atmosphere would have a negligible effect on surface
                    temperature.

                    We already know from our calculation that this is false. The
                    solution to this problem are atmospheric greenhouse gases
                    (mostly H2O, CO2, ozone and methane). These molecules can
                    absorb infrared radiation to trigger rotational or
                    vibrational transitions. As you can see in the bottom of the
                    figure, greenhouse gases absorb parts of the infrared
                    radiation in the atmospheric window. This additionally
                    absorbed heat is responsible for the warming of Earth’s
                    surface of about 30°C, from -15°C to +15°C. The largest
                    contribution to the natural greenhouse effect comes from
                    water (about 62%), with carbon dioxide being second with
                    22%.

                    Starting from the natural greenhouse effect it is easy to
                    understand the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. In brief,
                    because human activity is increasing concentration of
                    greenhouse gases more heat is absorbed and, among other
                    things, surface temperature rises. This topic will be

                    In the figure, we can see that there is incoming radiation

                    about 50% of incoming solar radiation is absorbed by the
                    surface. You can see on the very right that most of the
                    outgoing infrared radiation is reabsorbed by greenhouse
                    gases in the atmosphere. In total, there is an energy

                    Reality is still much more complex. Scientists have to take

                    our consideration, these calculations are far too complex.
                    Nevertheless, it is interesting to take a look at the
                    parameters that have been identified by scientists as key
                    for climate conditions and to investigate how these

                <p class="text-justify">
                    As we have seen in our physical analysis in the previous
                    section, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the
                    atmosphere strongly influences temperature on Earth, even
                    though they only compose 0.1% of gas in the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    In fact the main driver of climate change is the increase in
                    atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly
                    in carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons,
                    due to human activity.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    While all of these gases trap thermal energy within the
                    atmosphere, the origin of these gases varies. Carbon dioxide
                    mainly originates from the combustion of fossil fuels,
                    methane comes from agricultural practices and nitrous oxide
                    accrues during the burning of fossil fuel. Halocarbons on
                    the other hand are mostly man-made chemicals, which have
                    been applied as solvents or refrigerants.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Carbon dioxide surely is the most well-kown greenhouse gas.
                    Its atmospheric concentration has been measured since the
                    1950s. Atmospheric concentrations are usually given in parts
                    per million (ppm). Carbon dioxide concentration shows
                    seasonal variation, but the upwards trend is clearly visible
                    (see figure 4).

                <p class="text-justify">
                    To facilitate comparing effects of drivers of climate change
                    quantitatively, the concept of radiative forcing is
                    introduced. Radiative forcing (RF) is defined as the change
                    in the global energy balance of the Earth, relative to
                    preindustrial times.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    As you can see on the bottom of the figure, total radiative
                    forcing is positive, which has led to an energy uptake by
                    the climate system. The error bars represent the uncertainty
                    of the mean values.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Also, it can be seen that some anthropogenic effects,
                    aerosols and precursors especially, have a net negative RF.
                    However, uncertainties of these parameters are large, since
                    the way aerosols interact with radiation and their effect on
                    cloud formation has not yet been understood completely. On
                    the other hand, it is clear that all well-mixed greenhouse
                    gases in the atmosphere have a large positive value for RF,
                    causing the total value to be positive.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    To fully understand figure 5 , we have to understand how the
                    values for radiative forcing are determined. They are
                    calculated taking into account the atmospheric concentration
                    and spatial distribution of the driver of interest. Since
                    their physical interaction with radiation can be calculated
                    (see the previous section), the net effect on the total
                    energy within the climate system is determined.
                    Additionally, natural drivers, such as variance in solar
                    activity and volcanic eruptions are included.

                    As mentioned above, key uncertainties arise from the effect
                    of aerosols, cloud formation triggered by aerosols, the
                    effect of clouds, ozone and surface reflectivity. However,
                    even the models assuming the smallest reasonable values for
                    RF still find a RF to be positive.

                    In this section, we learned that total radiative forcing is
                    positive, which has led to an uptake of energy by the
                    climate system. The largest contribution comes from the
                    increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration since the
                    beginning of industrialisation.

                <h3>Observed Climate Changes</h3>
                <br />
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Observations of the climate system can be made based on
                    direct measurement or remote sensing from satellites.
                    Weather records on global scales began in the middle of the
                    19th century with measurements of temperature and
                    sea-levels. Measurements which depend on more sophisticated
                    apparatus, such as concentration measuring, commenced about
                    a century later. Our records can be extended to millions of
                    years, using paleoclimate reconstructions. Together, they
                    provide inside into the long- and short-term changes in the
                    climate system.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>Atmosphere</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Mean temperatures of the last three decades have been
                    successively warmer than any other decade since 1850. Mean
                    temperature for less than a decade is not regarded as a
                    suitable variable for climate, since natural variability
                    dominates at short time-scales. The warming trend is
                    measureable for nearly the entire globe, with the exception
                    of the Atlantic Ocean. Over the period 1880 to 2012, the
                    global average surface temperature increased by 0.85°C.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Also, more frequent warmer days and nights and fewer cold
                    days and nights have been detected over land area.
                </p>
                <h5>Oceans and sea level</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Warming of the atmosphere causes heat transfer to the
                    oceans. Ocean warming has been observed to be largest near
                    the surface. The ocean can store up to 90% of the extra
                    energy in the climate system accumulated until 2010. But
                    heat transfer is a slow process that will take hundreds of
                    years to complete.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Besides heat the ocean can also absorb carbon dioxide. About
                    30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide has been
                    absorbed by the ocean, causing ocean acidification.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    As the ocean is heated water expands, posing the largest
                    contribution to global sea-level rise. Additionally, melted
                    ice from on land glaciers and ice sheets increases this
                    effect. Global sea-level has risen in rates of 3.2 mm/yr
                    between 1993 and 2010. Further sea-level rise poses a risk
                    to seaports, islands and deep countries alike.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>Cryosphere</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The term cryosphere describes the portion of Earth’s surface
                    that is covered by frozen water. This includes glaciers, sea
                    ice, ice sheets and frozen ground (permafrost).
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Ice loss is largest for continental glaciers, followed by
                    ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet. While the Arctic sea
                    ice shows clear trends of melting, trends in the Antarctic
                    differ a lot by region. Northern Hemisphere snow cover has
                    decreased since 1950 and permafrost temperatures have risen.
                    Further temperature rise of permafrost soils could lead to
                    large-scale defrosting, causing further emissions of carbon
                    dioxide.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>Precipitation and extreme weather events</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Both heating of land mass and the oceans, is also
                    responsible for changes in large-scale patterns of
                    precipitation. Precipitation patterns vary a lot by region,
                    e.g. rainfall in the Mediterranean region decreases, while
                    in the rest of Europe an increase has been detected.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been
                    observed since about 1950. For example, frequency and
                    duration of heat waves increased over most land areas. Also,
                    more frequent and intense heavy precipitation events were
                    recorded.

                <h3>Attribution of Observed Changes</h3>
                <br />
                <p class="text-justify">
                    From observing the climate system, we know that time and
                    process of global warming match with industrialisation. It
                    is known that since the beginning of industrialisation,
                    concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
                    increased by nearly 50%. From the section on radiative
                    forcing (link here?) we know that our industrialised world
                    causes a positive RF in total.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    But can we really link positive RF to the observed changes
                    in climate? Or could spontaneous variability in the climate
                    system cause these changes?
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>Do uncertainties allow for natural causes?</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Natural variability of the climate system has to be observed
                    and understood to rule natural causes out as the driver of
                    climate change. Palaeoclimatology, the study of climates for
                    which direct measurements were not taken, is used to
                    reconstruct ancient climate.

                    From paleoclimate reconstructions we know that warmer and
                    colder periods occurred, even without industrialisation.
                    They were caused for example by variations in the orbit of
                    the Earth around the Sun or its own axis. These variations
                    usually had time-scales of 10 000 to 100 000 years.

                    Reconstructions reveal that every time it got warmer, an
                    increase in CO2 concentration followed. Initially small
                    variations in temperature increase because more CO2 is
                    emitted from warmer oceans. This avalanche effect can
                    trigger a switch from a cold to a warm stage. This allows
                    for speculation if human activity is really driving climate

                    most of the halocarbons, do not occur in nature and are
                    added to the atmosphere by human activity only. Also,
                    geographic distribution of gas concentrations around the
                    globe shows that in the more populated Northern Hemisphere
                    greenhouse gas concentrations are higher than average. This
                    matches with the fact that the observed atmospheric warming

                    In order to attribute the observed changes, climate

                    Future changes in the climate system can be estimated by
                    climate models. If you would like to gain a deeper
                    understanding of how these complex modelling processes work,

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Climate models that project the future are always based on
                    scenarios for future emissions. Estimating economic growth
                    and dependence on fossil fuels is a tricky task for the
                    upcoming decades, let alone for the next hundred years.
                    Modelling the climate beyond a century ago is very
                    uncertain, as we can only guess future emissions and we
                    cannot foresee future inventions. Also, prediction accuracy
                    decreases if we do not average over the entire Earth
                    surface. Local trends deviate from the calculated mean
                    trends. Until now, only predictions for temperature and
                    precipitation up to continental level are considered
                    accurate.

                    Simulations suggest that if greenhouse gases are emitted at
                    current rates or above, changes in climate until 2100 will
                    very likely be larger than those already observed. It will
                    become less efficient to remove excess CO2 from the
                    atmosphere by natural processes on land and in the ocean as
                    the planet warms. This positive carbon cycle feedback will
                    cause global warming to accelerate. Even if net emission
                    shrinks to zero and greenhouse gas concentrations are kept
                    constant at current levels, climate change would continue
                    for centuries.

                    the socio-economic impact of climate change if temperature
                    rises to the lower or upper limit. Estimates of sea-level

                    economic decline in 2020, due to the corona virus pandemic,
                    global yearly emissions decreased only about 7% in
                    comparison to 2019. Global emissions still increased,

                <p class="text-justify">
                    In summary, we learned that climate change is affected by
                    natural drivers as well as anthropogenic influence. Human
                    activity led to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in
                    the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases interact with solar
                    radiation in such a way that they trap thermal energy in the
                    climate system of the Earth.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    By observations and paleoclimate reconstructions we can
                    predict future climate developments. These predictions are
                    only certain for the near future and on global scale.
                    However, it is certain that plants, animals and humans will
                    be living with the consequences of climate change for the
                    next thousand years.
